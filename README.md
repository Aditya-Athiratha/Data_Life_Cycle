# Data_Life_Cycle

Our project mainly describes the data lifecycle of Data used in Crime and Safety in Residential
Areas. The project focuses on addressing the rise in criminal activity in residential neighborhoods,
with a specific emphasis on ensuring safety and security. We have taken the Static Dataset from
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2010-to-2019 and Streaming Dataset from
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present. We have a started a brief
analysis into Crime Statistics from 2010 to the present using Static Data sets and Streaming Datasets
from sources such as Data.gov.

Here the Use Case we have opted is Community: Residential Areas Issue: Crime and Safety; where
crime and safety are the main concerns. We want to improve the overall safety of residential
communities by exploring the aspects of this sector and offering practical insights to support crime
prevention measures.

The Data lifecycle includes Generation where raw data is generated from repositories such as
data.gov, Collection, Processing of Static, and Streaming Data.
Tools and applications were used throughout the project to support various stages of the data
lifecycle. Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which provides reliable infrastructure for processing and
storing data. Large datasets could be stored with GCP Storage Bucket, and distributed data
processing at scale was made possible by Dataproc's Hadoop architecture. 

Furthermore, Tools and applications such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP), GCP Storage Bucket, Dataproc, Hadoop
Architecture, HDFS, HIVE, and Spark were utilized at different phases. The next steps for the data
Science or Analyst teams involve performing queries in BigQuery, HIVE, and Spark to ensure
data Quality. Spark developed as a powerhouse for high-performance analytics and processing,
while HDFS and HIVE offered effective data management and querying capabilities.

The emphasis of our project is shifting to ensure data integrity and extract relevant insights as we
go into the next phase. Teams specializing in data science and analysis are prepared to explore the
datasets more thoroughly and run complex queries using BigQuery, HIVE, and Spark. These
searches will not only confirm the accuracy of the data but also reveal important trends and patterns
that are essential for well-informed decision-making. In addition, cutting-edge analytical methods
like predictive modeling and machine learning will be used to identify probable criminal hotspots
and create proactive risk-reduction strategies.
